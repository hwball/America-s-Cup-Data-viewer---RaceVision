# This is the first half a full year project completed in the third year of univercity.

It focuses on visualising the america's cup. The two .jar files that make up this repo 
are a snap shot of the full year porject at the time of the america's cup in june. They 
represent a mock data source designed to mimic the data sent out but the 2017 america's cup
and and visuliser for this data. The mock data can be changed to test the limits of the visuliser.
